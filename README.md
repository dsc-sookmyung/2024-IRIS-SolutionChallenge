# 🚨 Introduction: MissingYou
![d5bfc93299dcfc9f](https://github.com/dsc-sookmyung/2024-IRIS-SolutionChallenge/assets/68546023/9a944c30-dfe8-4857-925f-cc4603671baf)

In September 2021, a system was introduced in Korea to send missing person notification text to citizens when high-risk individuals, such as children, teenagers, disabled people, and dementia patients, go missing. This messaging system has proven effective, significantly reducing the average time to find missing persons in high-risk groups from 34 hours to 3 hours and 10 minutes through the sightings of the citizens. 

However, the process for transmission in this system is complex, involving passage through five organizations. Also, because they are text-based, missing person alert texts are easily forgotten by citizens and their use is limited by citizen fatigue.

Our team's app, "MissingYou", wants to help the reporter easily register a missing person report and ask as many people for help as soon as possible.

Leveraging the "Picture Superiority Effect," which suggests that visual information is easier to recognize and remember, the app is designed with a photo-oriented reporting system. The AI Image Generator can generate clothing images based on the provided information. Additionally, we provides location-based missing person reports and calculates the match rate between the sighting photos and the missing persons’ photos. Unlike one-way communication through existing systems, the app allows witnesses to check updates on the missing status through witness comments.

With "MissingYou", we want to expand beyond the existing high-risk missing persons ‘missing person notification text’ providing various types of missing reports and encouraging active sighting to involve everyone in creating a safe and peaceful community.
